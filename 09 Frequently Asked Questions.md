# 9. Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this a new Silk Road 2.0?

Absolutely not. The Silk Road was a centralized platform, controlled directly by a small group who ran it for profit. The marketplace was built specifically for a small subset of trade: illicit goods. 

OpenBazaar is entirely different. It’s a decentralized platform, not controlled by anyone, and not run for profit. It’s not being built for any subset of trade, but gives anyone in the world the power to buy and sell any type of goods and services with anyone else, using Bitcoin.

OpenBazaar isn’t Silk Road - version 2, it’s ecommerce - version 2.

### How will you keep illicit goods off of OpenBazaar?

OpenBazaar is a protocol for trading goods online, and a decentralized network for people to communicate with each other. Since the network isn’t centrally controlled (by us or anyone), we cannot directly prevent people from selling illicit goods.

The platform uses a reputation and rating system, as well as allowing reputable third parties help manage trade. We expect these checks and balances will strongly encourage legitimate trade on the network.

Sellers on the OpenBazaar network host their own products and are therefore directly responsible for complying with local laws (and their own conscience) when listing items or services. Users engaged in illicit activity cannot hide behind a third party service.

The world doesn’t have a standard protocol for trading goods and services online, nor does it have a network to share information about those goods and services. OpenBazaar finally creates a protocol and network that is free and open for all. As such, we expect that the use of OpenBazaar will largely reflect how society trades at large - almost entirely legitimate, positive trade with a small portion of people using it for illicit activity.

OB1 helps build and facilitate trade on the OpenBazaar network, and we will do everything in our power to encourage legal trade on the network. We haven’t volunteered a year of our time - and now left our careers to start this business - in order to create a new way to trade drugs. We are doing this to build the future of all trade.

### What about OpenBazaar’s beginnings as Dark Market?

Dark Market was a winning entry in a Toronto hackathon in April 2014. Following the release of the source code on Github, the developers of Dark Market decided to discontinue the project. A few days later, Brian Hoffman forked the project to continue development. Brian renamed the project to OpenBazaar, which reflected a shift in vision to create a free and open marketplace for all goods and services.

Since April 2014, we’ve seen OpenBazaar change substantially from the original Dark Market project. Only a small amount of the original code remains, and the majority of the features have been built by the OpenBazaar community, including the use of Ricardian Contracts, HD signing keys, and kademlia DHT.
